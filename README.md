## About this project...

This project was created to practice creating a React SPA with ReactJS, MaterialUI and possibly more! This project is an alternative layout to what was done using an existing template, as seen [here](https://github.com/samly97/architectui-react-theme-free).

This frontend component would be used in conjunction with a Golang API server, the latter of which is a private repo.

## Demos

### Update September 14th, 2020

I finished a prototype of an exercise page. In this page the user could see his workout data for a particular month. By default, it displays data for the current month.

The user could see their predicted max, which calculated based on their reps and the weight lifted. This is a useful metric to see if they are progressing in terms of strength/hypertrophy.

Demo is as follows:

TODO:

- Add tabs to show other workout metrics such as weekly volume, PRs, etc.
- Create page for Bench, Squat, and Deadlift
- Create a sidebar nav to navigate between pages
- Use React router to route those pages
